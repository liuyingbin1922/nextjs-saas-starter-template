## I. Core Principles of Transformers
### 1.1 Engineering Implementation of Electromagnetic Induction  
Transformers operate based on **Faraday's Law of Electromagnetic Induction**, achieving voltage/current conversion through coil turn ratios. When alternating current flows through the primary coil, the changing magnetic field induces electromotive force (EMF) in the secondary coil. The fundamental relationship is:

$$
\frac{V_p}{V_s} = \frac{N_p}{N_s}
$$


Where \[V_p\] and \[V_s\] represent primary/secondary voltages, and \[N_p\]/\[N_s\] denote coil turns. **The turn ratio directly determines step-up/step-down characteristics**:
- **Step-Up Transformer**: 

$$
N_s > N_p
$$

(e.g., power transmission systems)
- **Step-Down Transformer**: 

$$
N_s < N_p
$$
 

(e.g., smartphone chargers)

### 1.2 Power Conservation and Loss Mechanisms  
Under ideal conditions, \[P_p = P_s\] (input power = output power). Combining this with Ohm's Law yields the current relationship:

$$
 \frac{I_p}{I_s} = \frac{N_s}{N_p}
$$
 
Real-world applications must account for **copper losses** (resistive heating in windings) and **iron losses** (hysteresis/eddy current losses), with typical efficiency ranging 95-99%. For example, a transformer with 100W input and 98% efficiency delivers:

$$
 P_{out} = 100W \times 0.98 = 98W
$$

## II. Practical Problem Solving
### 2.1 Voltage Calculation Example  
> A transformer has 200 primary turns and 1000 secondary turns with 120V input. Calculate the output voltage.

**Solution**:  

$$
 \frac{120}{V_s} = \frac{200}{1000} \Rightarrow V_s = 600V
$$


### 2.2 Current & Efficiency Analysis  
> The above transformer drives a 10Ω load with 95% efficiency. Find the primary current.

**Step-by-Step Solution**:  
1. Secondary current: 
$$
I_s = \frac{600V}{10Ω} = 60A
$$

2. Theoretical power: 

$$
P_s = 600V \times 60A = 36kW
$$
3. Actual input power: 

$$
P_p = \frac{36kW}{0.95} ≈ 37.89kW
$$
s 
4. Primary current: 

$$
I_p = \frac{37890W}{120V} ≈ 315.75A
$$
